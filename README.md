# üåê Global Economic Data Visualization Dashboard

This is a full-stack SaaS web application built for the CS-5610 Final Project (Spring 2025).  
It allows users to manage and visualize country-level economic indicators using data from the World Bank API.

PLEASE NOTE:
My online deployment was not successful(possible CORS issue makes the frontend unable to fetch backend at render.com, while backend/database deployement was succeeful on render and railway.), this version was hardcoded with local environment.

You can check my deployed website built on another version of commit below, which is more buggy;
 This local hardcoded version is supposed to work better.
