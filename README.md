This submission as of Mar 31 2025 serves as part2 of the CS5610 final project.

For API development:
It has
Ping pong test endpoint;
Required /login /register /logout endpoints, and a post endpoint that is able to insert one item using the requireAuth middleware.

For Client development,
it has a register page and a login page, along with homepage, item list page and item inseration page, which all of them are able to execute commands and interact as expection.
While not asked for this part of assignment, I added a logout button to test some of the functions.
